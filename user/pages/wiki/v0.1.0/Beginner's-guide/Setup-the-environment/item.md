To begin working in HERD data analysis it is necessary to prepare the software
environment by installing the needed software packages and HerdSoftware. The
procedure is described in details in the 
[Download, configure, build and install](../../User's-manual/Download,-configure,-build-and-install.md)
section of the users' manual. The page describes how to install the needed 
software packages on different flavors of Linux and OSX, and then how to
build Herdsoftware and configure the environment for its usage. This is a
complete step-by-step guide for the first installation, but from time to time
you migth need to update your environment with new versions of the software
packages. In this case, please follow the
[update instructions](../../How-to/Update-the-software.md) that explains how to update
only the needed packages without having to reinstall everything from scratch.

The procedure is mostly automated and continuously tested, so it requires time
but it should not pose any seriuos difficulty.
