To quickly get in touch with colleagues, the [Discord](https://discord.com) instant
messaging system is a useful tool. It allows for chatting with individuals and
with groups, and also has additional features like the integration with Gitlab
which allows for example to receive notifications on repository activity.

# Join HERD Discord server
To join the HERD Discord server, click on [this link](https://discord.gg/mdYUwZnvge).
You will be asked for an email address where an invitation link will be sent.
Follow the instructions to either create a new account or join the server
with your existing account.

After joining you will be able to send messages to the HERD people to ask for
help or discuss topics.

# Clients
Discord provides several type of clients: web-based from the browser, desktop and
mobile:

The desktop and mobile clients are available for all the major operating
systems / browsers.

# Channels
Channels are discussion groups for specific topics. If you are interested in a 
discussion then join the related channel. The `sw_management` channel  receives
notifications from Gitlab when there is activity on the repository, so join
it if you want to be updated about software development.

For quick meetings or group calls you can also use the *voice channels*. These
effectively act as videoconference rooms where you can share your webcam and screen
as well.

# Private conversations
Unlike Slack, on Discord you must add someone as a friend (right click -> "Add Friend"; or using the user ID, which is a combination 
of username + 4 random digits) before initiating private conversations. You can find the user ID 
clicking on the corresponding user on the right panel.

These chats are outside the server but everything else is just the same. You can add people to
a conversation and have voice/video calls as well.
