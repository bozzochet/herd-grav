(The primary objectives of HERD are etc...). To achieve HERD’s science objectives, HERD must have the capability of accurate electron and gamma-ray energy and direction measurement (tens of GeV – 10TeV), adequate cosmic ray energy measurement with charge determination (up to PeV). The baseline design includes two main parts to achieve HERD’s measurement objectives: the micro silicon strip tracker (STK) covering the top and fours sides of the instrument, for incident particle trajectory and nucleon charge measurement; the LYSO crystal calorimeter (CALO), for the incident gamma-ray, electron and cosmic ray nucleon energy measurement.
